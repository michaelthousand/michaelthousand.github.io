                    <p>I grew up surrounded by technology. My parents owned their own software sales company when I was growing up and 
                        I took apart my first computer at 7 years old. I have been modding video games in my spare time for years and am now
                        hoping to launch a new career working with one of my first loves: <strong><em>tech</em></strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>I began my undergraduate career as a psychology student before ultimately turning to philosophy. I noticed quickly that
                        philosophical logic proofs had a number of similarities to computer programming. This allowed me to quickly teach myself
                        how to read lines of code and change the behavior of the video games I was playing. I began customizing all of the games
                        I was playing to be exactly how I wanted them, complete with custom characters, events, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the past three years, I have been working for a healthcare company in Wisconsin. I recently began a certificate program at
                        the University of California - Berkeley for <a href="https://extension.berkeley.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=17558767">Software Development and Programming</a>.
                        I also have been working through CodeAcademy's program for <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path">Full-Stack Engineering</a>.
                        I am hoping to use this website to display my skills as I develop them. You will find a table below with where I feel I am at in each technical category
                        (as well as some other skills I have acquired through my current and previous careers). You will also find a brief introduction to my work and education background.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am hoping to continue developing at a rapid pace and move into a position where I can work on application/video game development or in cybersecurity.
                        If you believe that I may be a fit for your company or project, please feel free to reach out via the Contact page.
